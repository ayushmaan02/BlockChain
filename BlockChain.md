# BLOCKCHAIN

## ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN

`
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
`

## WHY BOLCKCHAIN

`
Why blockchain is important: Business runs on information. The faster itâ€™s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.

## BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPERS

1. Applicatiion Developers

        Application developers are more than 90% in this field, the developers who are using the  existing blockchain for creating something new out of it.

        Language needed to learn are: 
        - Solidity
        - Javascript
        - Python

2. Core developers

        Core developers are those who either build their own Blockchain or update the existing chains using this languages.

        Language needed to learn are :-
        - Go Lang
        - C++
        - Rust

## [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/)

- Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

- Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.
