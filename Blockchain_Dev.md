# BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPERS

**1. Applicatiion Developers**

        Application developers are more than 90% in this field, 
        the developers who are using the  existing blockchain for creating something new out of it.

        Language needed to learn are: 
        - Solidity
        - Javascript
        - Python

**2. Core developers**

        Core developers are those who either build their own Blockchain or update the existing chains using this languages.

        Language needed to learn are :-
        - Go Lang
        - C++
        - Rust

- Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

- Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

- Solidity is used to write **smart contracts** on the Ethereum Blockchain

- JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

- While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

- JavaScript can be used in both frontend and Backend.
